/* READ ME FOR ZOOM.JS

Steps to follow in order to use zoom.js:

1/ Upload image using the highest resolution possible. CSS will resize the image to make it fit in the post. 
2/ In the post editor, add data-action="zoom" attribute to the image.
3/ Enjoy!

Optional: 

If you need to display a different image when zooming, add the data-original="../../wp-content/uploads/path_to_different_image" attribute to the image.
